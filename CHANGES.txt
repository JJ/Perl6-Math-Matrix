 0.3.0:
    - 2018.5.
    - added MM operator as shortcut for Math::Matrix.new()
    - added splice-rows and splice-columns replacing prepend-*, append-* 
      and planned insert-* and delete-*
    - added own methods for .list (flat) and .Array context
    - added proper .gist for type object (like all types have) showing (Math::Matrix)
    - redone .gist and .full allows now complex numbers and scientific notation
    - new property type return widest cell type
    - refreshed doc synopsis and description, improved docs overall
    - added .appveyor.yml file: win CI support to github project

 0.2.0:
    - 2018.3.26
    - add methods: add-row, add-column, multiply-row, multiply-column, map-row, map-column
    - add methods move-row, move-column, swap-rows, swap-columns, 
          prepend-vertically, append-vertically, prepend-horizontally, append-horizontally
    - add method elem to check if any cell is equal to value or in a range
    - new property: antisymmetric
    - new category: list like ops
    - submatrix with 2 Int parameter works now as expected
    - accessor column becomes faster
    - move docs into Matrix.pod
    - added docs

 0.1.8:
    - 2018.3.20
    - added method: tensorProduct, alias infix op x, unicode alias âŠ—
    - added method: conjugated, is-self-adjoint, is-unitary, is-positive-semidefinite
    - more property setting optimization in constructors
    - new category for methods: structural ops

 0.1.7:
    - 2018.3.18
    - added methods: elems, list-rows and list-columns, full
    - documented, but forgot to implement: commutative + and - op
    - limit gist for optimal shell output
    - change norm names rowsum => row-sum, columnsum => column-sum
    - added docs, operator got own section
    - started changelog

 0.1.6:
    - 2018.3.15
    - added methods: reduce-rows and reduce-columns, 
    - added and clarified docs

 0.1.5:
    - 2018.3.14
    - accessors column and row now return consistently lists (like diagonal)
    - expanded power of submatrix accessor
    - added ops: |.| as alias for determinant, and prefix - as alias for negated
    - renamed apply method to map
    - renamed negate method to negated (consistency, transposed and inverted)
    - added and clarified docs
