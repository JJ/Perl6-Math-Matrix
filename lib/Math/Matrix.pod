=head1 NAME

Math::Matrix - create, compare, compute and measure 2D matrices

=head1 VERSION

0.1.8

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Matrices are tables with rows (counting from 0) and columns of numbers: 

 transpose, invert, negate, add, subtract, multiply, dot product, size, determinant, 
 rank, kernel, trace, norm, decompositions and so on

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl6 already provide a lot of tools to work with array, shaped array, and so on,
however, even hyper operators does not seem to be enough to do matrix calculation
Purpose of that library is to propose some tools for Matrix calculation.

I should probably use shaped array for the implementation, but i am encountering
some issues for now. Problem being it might break the syntax for creation of a Matrix,
use with consideration...

Matrices are readonly - all operations and derivatives are new objects.

=head2 Constructors
=head3 new( [[...],...,[...]] )

The default constructor, takes arrays of arrays of numbers.
Each second level array represents a row in the matrix.
That is why their length has to be the same.

   Math::Matrix.new( [[1,2],[3,4]] ) creates:

   1 2
   3 4

=head3 new-zero

This method is a constructor that returns an zero matrix of the size given in parameter.
If only one parameter is given, the matrix is quadratic. All the cells are set to 0.

    say Math::Matrix.new-zero( 3, 4 ) :

    0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0

=head3 new-identity

This method is a constructor that returns an identity matrix of the size given in parameter
All the cells are set to 0 except the top/left to bottom/right diagonale, set to 1

    say Math::Matrix.new-identity( 3 ):
  
    1 0 0
    0 1 0
    0 0 1

=head3 new-diagonal

This method is a constructor that returns an diagonal matrix of the size given
by count of the parameter.
All the cells are set to 0 except the top/left to bottom/right diagonal, set to given values.

    say Math::Matrix.new-diagonal( 2, 4, 5 ):

    2 0 0
    0 4 0
    0 0 5

=head3 new-vector-product

This method is a constructor that returns a matrix which is a result of 
the matrix product (method dotProduct, or operator dot) of a column vector
(first argument) and a row vector (second argument).

    my $matrixp = Math::Matrix.new-vector-product([1,2,3],[2,3,4]);
    my $matrix = Math::Matrix.new([2,3,4],[4,6,8],[6,9,12]);       # same matrix

=head2 Accessors
=head3 cell

    Gets value of element in third row and fourth column. (counting always from 0)

    my $value = $matrix.cell(2,3);

=head3 row

    Gets values of specified row (first required parameter) as a list.
    That would be (1, 2) if matrix is [[1,2][3,4]].

    my @values = $matrix.row(0);

=head3 column

    Gets values of specified column (first required parameter) as a list.
    That would be (1, 4) if matrix is [[1,2][3,4]].

    my @values = $matrix.column(0);

=head3 diagonal

    Gets values of diagonal elements. That would be (1, 4) if matrix is [[1,2][3,4]].

    my @values = $matrix.diagonal();

=head3 submatrix

    Subset of cells of a given matrix by deleting rows and/or columns. 

    The first and simplest usage is by choosing a cell (by coordinates).
    Row and column of that cell will be removed.

    my $m = Math::Matrix.new([[1,2,3,4][2,3,4,5],[3,4,5,6]]);     # 1 2 3 4
                                                                    2 3 4 5
                                                                    3 4 5 6
    say $m.submatrix(1,2);     # 1 2 4
                                 3 4 6                            

    If you provide two pairs of coordinates (row column), these will be counted as
    left upper and right lower corner of and area inside the original matrix,
    which will the resulting submatrix.

    say $m.submatrix(1,1,1,3); # 2 3 4        

    When provided with two lists of values (one for the rows - one for columns)
    a new matrix will be created with the old rows and columns in that new order.
    
    $m.submatrix((3,2),(1,2)); # 4 5
                                 3 4

=head2 Type Conversion And Output Flavour
=head3 Bool

    Conversion into Bool context. Returns False if matrix is zero
    (all cells equal zero as in is-zero), otherwise True.
    
    $matrix.Bool
    ? $matrix           # alias
    if $matrix          # Bool context too

=head3 Numeric

    Conversion into Numeric context. Returns number (amount) of cells (as .elems).
    Please note, only prefix a prefix + (as in: + $matrix) will call this Method.
    A infix (as in $matrix + $number) calls .add($number).
    
    $matrix.Numeric   or      + $matrix

=head3 Str

    Conversion into String context. Returns content of all cells in the
    data structure form like "[[..,..,...],[...],...]"
    
    put $matrix     or      print $matrix

=head3 perl

    Conversion into String like context that can reevaluated into the same
    object later. ( "Math::Matrix.new([[..,..,...],[...],...])" )
    
    my $clone = eval $matrix.perl;

=head3 list-rows

    Returns a list of lists, reflecting the row-wise content of the matrix.
    
    Math::Matrix.new( [[1,2],[3,4]] ).list-rows ~~ ((1 2) (3 4))     # True

=head3 list-columns

    Returns a list of lists, reflecting the row-wise content of the matrix.
    
    Math::Matrix.new( [[1,2],[3,4]] ).list-columns ~~ ((1 3) (2 4)) # True

=head3 gist

    Limited tabular view for the shell output. Just cuts off excessive
    rows and columns. Implicitly called while:
    
    say $matrix;      # output when matrix has more than 100 cells

    1 2 3 4 5 ..
    3 4 5 6 7 ..
    ...

=head3 full

    Full tabular view (all rows and columns) for the shell or file output.
    
    say $matrix.full;

=head2 Boolean Properties
=head3 equal

    Checks two matrices for equality. They have to be of same size and
    every element of the first matrix on a particular position has to be equal
    to the element (on the same position) of the second matrix.
    
    if $matrixa.equal( $matrixb ) {
    if $matrixa ~~ $matrixb {



=head3 is-square

    True if number of rows and colums are the same.

    if $matrix.is-square {


=head3 reduce-columns

Similar to reduce-rows, this method reduces each column to one value in the 
resulting list:

    say Math::Matrix.new( [[1,2],[3,4]] ).reduce-columns(&[*]);  # prints (3, 8)


=head1 Operators

The Module overloads or uses a range of well and less known ops.
+, -, * and ~~ are commutative.

    my $a   = +$matrix               # Num context, amount (count) of cells
    my $b   = ?$matrix               # Bool context, True if any cell has a none zero value
    my $str = ~$matrix               # String context, matrix content as data structure

    $matrixa ~~ $matrixb             # check if both have same size and they are cell wise equal

    my $sum =  $matrixa + $matrixb;  # cell wise sum of two same sized matrices
    my $sum =  $matrix  + $number;   # add number to every cell

    my $dif =  $matrixa - $matrixb;  # cell wise difference of two same sized matrices
    my $dif =  $matrix  - $number;   # subtract number from every cell
    my $neg = -$matrix               # negate value of every cell

    my $p   =  $matrixa * $matrixb;  # cell wise product of two same sized matrices
    my $sp  =  $matrix  * $number;   # multiply number to every cell

    my $tp  =  $a x $b;              # tensor product 
    my $tp  =  $a ⊗ $b;              # tensor product, unicode alias

    my $dp  =  $a dot $b;            # dot product of two fitting matrices (cols a = rows b)
    my $dp  =  $a ⋅ $b;              # dot product, unicode alias

    my $c   =  $a **  3;             # $a to the power of 3, same as $a dot $a dot $a
    my $c   =  $a ** -3;             # alias to ($a dot $a dot $a).inverted
    my $c   =  $a **  0;             # creats an right sized identity matrix

     | $matrix |                     # determinant
    || $matrix ||                    # Euclidean (L2) norm
